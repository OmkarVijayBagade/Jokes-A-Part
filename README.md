# 🎭 Jokes-A-Part

A SwiftUI-based jokes application with clean UI, smooth animations, and Firebase-powered user onboarding.

# 📌 About the Project

Jokes-A-Part is a fun, minimal, and modern jokes app built using SwiftUI.
The goal is simple: deliver jokes instantly through a clean interface while keeping the experience interactive and playful.

The app supports:
    •    🔐 User Sign Up / Login (Email, Username, Profile Picture)
    •    😂 Random Joke Generator
    •    📚 Jokes Library (Custom collections created by users)
    •    ⭐ Favourites Screen
    •    ✨ Full animations + haptics for interactions
    •    ☁️ Firebase backend for authentication & user data

This project is built to learn end-to-end iOS development, from design → development → deployment.
